This application can be used to create a collage from varoius small images. An image can be scalled, rotated or moved throughout the canvas as requried. A single image can be moved to the front or pushed to the back as required i.e. it has an option to order the image stack. 

Following are the instructions to use this tool:
A. Adding an image(2 ways) 
    1. Images can be dragged in the canvas.
    2. A small GUI panel is shown on the canvas, it will enable users to add/browse images into the canvas.

B. Deleting an image - Pressing 'delete' button deletes the selected image

C. Translating an image - Images can be dragged to any position as required

D. Rotating an image - Select an image, press control key and move the cursor to either left or right to rotate the image clockwise or anti-clockwise, respectively.

E. Scaling an image - Select an image, click on the red spots on the grid to scale the selected image

F. Saving an image - Press key 's' to save an image before saving the image i.e. maximize window > move menu panel outside viewing area > restore window size to normal > press 's'
The saved image will appear in the /data folder

G. Controlling stacking order of images - Select an image and press up or down arrow to, respectively push up or push down, the selected image in the image stack

Following are the images I created using this tool. I have used small png images of objects and merge them into a single image:
